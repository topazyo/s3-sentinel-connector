## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests
- **Goal:** Verify the functionality of individual components (e.g., functions, classes, modules) in isolation.
- **Framework:** Pytest
- **Location:** `tests/unit/`
- **Details:** Mocks and stubs are used to isolate components from external dependencies (e.g., AWS services, Azure services, file system).

### Integration Tests
- **Goal:** Verify the interaction between different components of the application.
- **Framework:** Pytest
- **Location:** `tests/integration/`
- **Details:** May involve limited interaction with actual external services (e.g., localstack for AWS, Azure emulators if available) or carefully controlled test instances.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests
- **Goal:** Verify the complete application workflow from the user's perspective or from the system's entry point to its exit point.
- **Framework:** Pytest, possibly with custom scripting.
- **Location:** `tests/e2e/`
- **Details:** Involves deploying the application or a significant part of it and testing against real (or near-real) dependencies. These tests are typically slower and more complex.

### Performance Tests
- **Goal:** Evaluate the application's performance characteristics (e.g., latency, throughput, resource utilization) under various load conditions.
- **Tools:** (To be determined - e.g., Locust, k6, custom scripts)
- **Location:** `tests/performance/`
- **Details:** Focus on identifying bottlenecks and ensuring the application meets performance targets.

### Security Tests
- **Goal:** Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- **Tools:** Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools, dependency vulnerability scanners (e.g., `safety`).
- **Details:** Includes checks for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10), secure configuration, and dependency security. Compliance checks (`scripts/check_compliance.sh`) also form part of security testing.

## Test Execution

### Local Development
- Run tests using `pytest`:
  ```bash
  # Run all tests
  pytest

  # Run tests in a specific file
  pytest tests/unit/test_example.py

  # Run tests with coverage
  pytest --cov=src tests/
  ```

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Tests are automatically executed on every push and pull request to the main branches.
- CI pipeline includes steps for:
  - Linting and static analysis
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - (Potentially) E2E tests on a staging environment
  - Building artifacts (e.g., Docker container)

## Code Coverage
- We aim for a high level of code coverage for unit and integration tests.
- Coverage reports are generated during CI runs.
- Low coverage in new contributions may require additional tests.

## Reporting Bugs
- If a test fails, or you find a bug, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for details on how to report it.
